## Chicago Ruby Hack Night December 2019: Traveling Santa

To Run:
Clone from https://github.com/adbasner/TravelingSantaRubyHackNight.git

In terminal, run 'ruby traveling_santa.rb'

## Description

It's been been a rough year and only a handful of American cities have
any children making the "nice" list.

We have a [list of cities and their coordinates](nice-kid-cities.csv)
and want to figure out a route that gets things over for Santa quickly and
efficiently, starting and ending at his house at the north pole.
